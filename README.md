                        What you have learned from the project.
This assignment has been really beneficial, i have learnt about the various tools needed to build a website.
Putting them into use has really helped me appreciate its importance.
Although i have written some codes on a website page but havent built a full one one my own but this assignment has provided that avenue.
Other resources like Git and Github has been a bonus, constant commits and pushes have helped me really understan the concept.
